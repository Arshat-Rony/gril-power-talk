                <p className='text-gray-600 text-xl'>Girl Power Talk was founded on the idea that young India needs an innovative new work culture that equally harnesses peopleâ€™s talents, irrespective of their gender. Girl Power Talk is more than a company. We are a movement rooted in empowerment, professional ambition, and social impact. For generations, women have been relegated to secondary roles, and the youth exploited for their energy and inexperience. We are a culture that will make history by changing this dynamic and writing the beautiful next chapter in this story.</p>
